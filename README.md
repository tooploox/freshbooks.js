#Freshbooks.js

Freshbooks.js is a node.js module providing a wrapper to the [FreshBooks]
(http://www.freshbooks.com) API.

All API method are fairly well documented at [FreshBooks Developers]
(http://developers.freshbooks.com) but if you find a discrepancy between the 
docs and this wrapper feel free to file an "Issue".

## Installation

    $ npm install freshbooks
        
Note: This module utilises [libxmljs](https://github.com/polotek/libxmljs). You 
will need have the **libxml2** library installed and also the **libxml2-devel** 
(**libxml2-dev** on debian systems) package. This comes with the `xml2-config`
utility that is needed for compiling.  **This command must be in your path.**

## Example

    var FreshBooks = require("freshbooks");
    
    var freshbooks = new FreshBooks(api_url, api_token)
      , invoice = new freshbooks.Invoice();

    invoice.get(invoice_id, function(err, invoice) {
      if(err) { //returns if an error has occured, ie invoice_id doesn't exist.
        console.log(err);
      } else {
        console.log("Invoice Number:" + invoice.number);
      }
    });

## Changelog

**Update 14/7:** Just entered version 0.1.1! Most methods now accept an optional
id first argument (similar to how invoice.get() works). Examples have been 
updated *and* all tests are passing.

**Update 8/7:** We've just entered version 0.1.0! All required API features are 
now implemented excluding callback and system.

**Update 5/6:** I've implimented about 75% of the API. Most of the core features 
are working but i'm still working through some minor issues. Tests are working 
now though!

**Update 4/6:** This project is very much a *WORK IN PROGRESS*. So far I've 
implimented the majority of the Invoice API and am tidying up the code before 
launching into the other APIs. I've also decided
to take some liberties on some aspects of the API, ie replacing 
invoice.lines.add/delete/update methods with Array.pop/push, as frankly there 
are better ways to interact with the API in JS than is currently implimented.
